Code and data for my article Capital Asset Pricing Model for Stochastic Portfolio Theory. Data file SizeDeciles.xlsx taken from Professor Kenneth French's online data library for stock deciles returns and size, and Federal Reserve Economic Data web site for short-term Treasury rates which provide risk-free returns. We ignore the bottom two (9th and 10th) deciles, corresponding to microcap stocks. Python file code0.py is for code analyzing the data with top (1st) decile as the benchmark. Python file code1.py is for code with ottom (8th) decile as the benchmark. Save the code and data files to the same folder and run the code. It will generate the plots and results. R-markdown file curve.html is for simulation of the capital distribution curve for the linear case. It contains the code and the result.
